# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Automatic Gate Security System with Management Information System (MIS) is designed for Holy Family High School to enhance campus security through RFID-based access control. The system will replace manual gatekeeping methods with an automated solution that provides real-time monitoring, comprehensive logging, and administrative control. The system is admin-only (no user registration) where administrators manage RFID card details, and all access attempts are logged for reporting purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Admin Authentication System

**User Story:** As a school administrator, I want to securely log into the system, so that I can manage gate security and access controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and grant access to the dashboard
2. WHEN an administrator enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL deny access and display an error message
3. WHEN an administrator is inactive for 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out for security
4. IF an administrator fails login 3 times THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 15 minutes

### Requirement 2: RFID Card Management

**User Story:** As a school administrator, I want to manage RFID card details for authorized personnel, so that I can control who has access to the school premises.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator adds a new RFID card THEN the system SHALL store the card ID, user name, role, and status in the database
2. WHEN an administrator updates card details THEN the system SHALL modify the existing record and log the change
3. WHEN an administrator deactivates a card THEN the system SHALL prevent that card from granting access
4. WHEN an administrator searches for a card THEN the system SHALL display matching results with user details
5. IF a duplicate RFID card ID is entered THEN the system SHALL reject the entry and display an error message

### Requirement 3: RFID Access Control

**User Story:** As an authorized person with an RFID card, I want to tap my card on the scanner, so that I can gain access to the school premises.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid RFID card is scanned THEN the system SHALL grant access and open the gate
2. WHEN an invalid or deactivated RFID card is scanned THEN the system SHALL deny access and keep the gate closed
3. WHEN any RFID card is scanned THEN the system SHALL log the attempt with timestamp, card ID, and access result
4. WHEN the gate is opened THEN the system SHALL automatically close it after 10 seconds
5. IF the RFID scanner fails to read a card THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### Requirement 4: Access Logging and Reports

**User Story:** As a school administrator, I want to view detailed logs of all access attempts, so that I can monitor security and generate reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any RFID card is scanned THEN the system SHALL record timestamp, card ID, user name, access result, and gate location
2. WHEN an administrator requests access logs THEN the system SHALL display entries with filtering options by date, user, or status
3. WHEN an administrator generates a report THEN the system SHALL export data in PDF or Excel format
4. WHEN viewing logs THEN the system SHALL display real-time updates of new access attempts
5. IF the database is full THEN the system SHALL archive old logs while maintaining recent 6 months of data

### Requirement 5: Dashboard Monitoring

**User Story:** As a school administrator, I want a real-time dashboard showing gate activities, so that I can monitor security status and respond to incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current gate status, recent activities, and system health
2. WHEN a security incident occurs THEN the system SHALL display alerts and notifications on the dashboard
3. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show statistics like daily access count, failed attempts, and active cards
4. WHEN an administrator clicks on an alert THEN the system SHALL display detailed information about the incident
5. IF the system detects unusual activity patterns THEN the system SHALL generate automatic alerts

### Requirement 6: Database Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database to be automatically created and maintained, so that the system can store and retrieve data reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts for the first time THEN the system SHALL create all necessary database tables if they don't exist
2. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity and prevent corruption
3. WHEN the database is accessed THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations safely
4. WHEN system backup is needed THEN the system SHALL provide database export functionality
5. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and attempt reconnection

### Requirement 7: System Security and Reliability

**User Story:** As a school administrator, I want the system to be secure and reliable, so that it can protect the school premises effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN all sensitive data SHALL be encrypted in the database
2. WHEN users interact with the system THEN all inputs SHALL be validated to prevent security vulnerabilities
3. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors for troubleshooting while maintaining operation
4. WHEN power outages happen THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and resume normal operation when power returns
5. IF unauthorized access attempts are detected THEN the system SHALL log the attempts and alert administrators
