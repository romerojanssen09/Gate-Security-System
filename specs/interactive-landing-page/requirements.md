# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interactive Landing Page with Gate Visualization is designed to transform the current login page into an engaging landing page that showcases the gate security system in action. The page will feature animated UI elements showing cars entering through the gate after RFID scanning, creating an immersive experience that demonstrates the system's functionality. The admin login will be accessible through a modal interface, maintaining security while providing a more user-friendly experience.
